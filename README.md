# "Bayesian Digit Analysis" - O'Bayes 2019 - University of Warwick

This goal of this repository is to share the data and the code that were used in the "Bayesian Digit Analysis" poster (presented in the O'Bayes 2019 conference) and to allow for the reproducibility of obtained results.

## Instructions

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run all the R scripts provided in this reposirory and obtain the desired outputs, it is only required that two R packages are installed:

```
install.packages("Hmisc", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE) 
```

The Hmisc is necessairy to export R tables in TeX format and the tidyverse package is only used in the plots.r script to make graphs.
