# Bayesian Digit Analysis - O'Bayes 2019 (Warwick, UK)

## Overview

This repository accompanies the Bayesian Digit Analysis [poster](https://github.com/pedro-teles-fonseca/bda-poster-warwick/blob/master/poster.pdf), presented in the [O'Bayes 2019](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/robert/0bayesconference/) conference in the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk) (UK). The purpose of this repository is to share the data and the code that were used, facilitating the replicability of obtained results. Some supplementary graphs and tables are also provided.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

In order to run the R scripts provided in this repository, the following R packages are required:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("Hmisc")
library("tidyverse") 
```

It is still possible to reproduce all the results in the poster without installing any package since `Hmisc` is only used to export R tables in TeX format and `tidyverse` is only used to produce plots, which are supplementary material. 

### Data

The raw data can be found in the `raw-data.xls` file, stored in the `data-raw` folder. The reorganized version of the dataset that is imported by the R scripts is the `data.txt` file, stored in the `data` folder. 

### Reproducibility

We provide a self-contained Rstudio workflow that facilitates the replicability of all the results in the poster. Open `bda-poster-warwick.Rproj` first in order to direct R to the correct working directory. After that, all the R scripts stored in the `R` folder should run smoothly.

### R Scripts

* `read-data.R` is an auxiliary script that is called within other scripts to import the data. 

* `auxiliary-functions.R` contains several functions that we developed specifically for Bayesian digit analysis. This script is called within other scripts when necessary. 

* The tables in the poster can be reproduced with `poster-tables-mu-dir.R` and `poster-tables-bin-beta.R`.

### Supplementary Materials

* Plots comparing observed versus expected digit frequencies can be found in the `plots` folder. The code that generates the plots can be found in `plots.R`.

* The `tables-aux` folder contains the auxiliary tables `bin-beta-aux-austria.tex`, `bin-beta-aux-belgium.tex`, `bin-beta-aux-ireland.tex`, `bin-beta-aux-luxembourg.tex`, `bin-beta-aux-portugal.tex`, `mu-dir-aux-bl1.tex` and `mu-dir-aux-bl2.tex` which are generated by `aux-tables-bin.beta.R` and `aux-tables-mu-dir.R`. In `aux-tables.tex` we put together all these tables and perform some aesthetic changes obtaining `aux-tables.pdf`, a user-friendly compilation of all the tables in the poster.
